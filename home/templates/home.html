          WHO WE ARE
        </h5>
        <p>
          Montage Studio was created by a group of young engineering students of
          RUET and RU, they chose their passion as their profession and this
          incident of their life have been pushing them constantly to expand
          their potentiality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now Montage Studio has one of the highest number of fan
          following among Bangladeshi wedding photography Facebook pages based
          in Rajshahi. Among many other achievements we recognize this as the
          most important one as it directly indicates how many people are
          relating with us personally. Their likes and comments inspire us to do
          better every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last 3 years we have covered more than 100+ events. Our team is
          a small but strong team of 4 Photographers, cinematographers &amp;
          Editors. All our photographers are highly educated, most of them are
          engineers. Recently we have taken Montage Studio to an countrywide
          level.
